          All people in the United States, regardless of immigration status, have certain rights and protections under the U.S. Constitution. The ILRCâ€™s Red Cards help people assert their rights and defend themselves in many situations, such as when ICE agents go to a home.

        Hello! My name is Lewaa Bahmad. I built the Digital Red Card mobile application and this website. As of yet, no one else has contributed to it but I would love it if this could be a collaborative, open source project. Should you want to contributem, there are plenty of opportunities. These include:
      %ul
        %li Software Development
        %li Design Work
        %li Transalations
        %li Voice Recordings
      %p
        I've touched on the roadmap for the app but here is what I plan to work on in the short term:
      %ul
        %li Internationalization, or translation of content into multiple languages.
        %li The capacity to play aloud the Red Card's content in multiple languages. 
        %li More sharing functionality. 
        %li The ability to request physical Red Cards. 
        %li The ability to point out and share ICE activity :)
        %li More educational content.
